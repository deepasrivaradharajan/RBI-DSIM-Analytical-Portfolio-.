# 🇮🇳 RBI DSIM Analytical Project: Banking Sector Stability Assessment

Applicant:Deepasri V
Focus:Application of Quantitative Data Analysis to Systemic Financial Risk and Regulatory Metrics.



# Banking Sector Composite Stability Assessment

Objective: To demonstrate an understanding of RBI's regulatory role by assessing the systemic health of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) over a simulated three-year period.

|     Metric      |  Result |
|     :---        |     :--- |
| Data Source | Simulated RBI DBIE Quarterly Data (NPA Ratio, CRAR, etc.) |
|Analytical Metric | Composite Stability Score |
| Score Volatility (Std Dev) |Average Composite Stability Score: 7.15
                                Standard Deviation of Score (Volatility): 0.98

Methodology & Analysis:
1.  Data: Used time-series data mimicking quarterly reports on key banking sector indicators.
2.  Score Calculation:Acustom Composite Stability Score was calculated quarterly by weighting and integrating metrics like the NPA Ratio (inverted, as high NPA is higher risk) and the CRAR (Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio).
3. Risk Assessment:The project's primary output is a time-series plot of the score and its Standard Deviation, which quantifies the stability (volatility) of the entire banking sector—a core function of the RBI.
